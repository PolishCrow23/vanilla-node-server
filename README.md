Vanilla Node.js Server made with conditional statements. Input on the index page takes input from the user. If the value equals "iga" the server sends         
```
const objToJson = {
          name: "iga",
          status: "student",
          currentOccupation: "3D modeler"
        }
```
object. If the value is anything else than "iga" it sends
```
        const objToJson = {
          name: "unknown",
          status: "unknown",
          currentOccupation: "unknown"
        }
  ```
object.
